# INITIAL

**IDEA:** Predict the best place to wait in a Parisian station

## Ideas for the project

- (P) kinetic Monte Carlo - model each station and simulate people entering the station, uniformly* from each entry.
    - (S) instead of uniformly I would propose a time dependent weighting average over the various entry points of one station (various diffusion points)
- (P) simulate analytically using modes near each entry 
- (R) frequentist approach to parameter destinations 
- (S) we have to find a way, again weighted to model the people that get out of the train, eg. people going out in le guichet are gathered in one end of the train

## Work to be done

- (S) we have to check for similar works in bibliography and possible techniques that have been used
- (S) we should find a way to acquire data about passengers numbers
